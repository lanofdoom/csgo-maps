## Installation
Extract ``maps.tar.xz`` into your server's ``css/csgo`` directory.

Optionally, consider pointing your server's ``sv_downloadurl`` using the value corresponding with the version you've downloaded. This significant speeds up client map downloads and saves bandwidth on your server by leveraging GitHub's CDN for map downloads.

If setting ``sv_downloadurl``, you are also required to set ``sv_allowdownload 1`` and ``sv_allowupload 1``.
