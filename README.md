# LAN of DOOM Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Maps

This is an archive of Counter-Strike Global Offensive maps for the LAN of DOOM
server.

Information about the author and license of each map can be found in
the `README.md` files in its subdirectory.

## Structure

Each map has all of it's data files organized into a `gamedir`-rooted
top-level folder. A map with a single .bsp file would end up at
`map_name/maps/map_name.bsp`.

To install the maps from this repository, the contents of each
subdirectory should be copied to the server's `gamedir` (eg
`.../srcds/csgo`).
